## Footnote

In this book, Freeman explores the origins of social network analysis (SNA). He traces the history of ideas about social structure and network patterning across different social science disciplines, revealing how they were eventually woven together into a coherent field of study. The book reviews these developments and examines the social processes that brought the different "schools" of network analysis together into a single, unified approach. [^1].
